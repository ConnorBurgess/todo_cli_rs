# todo_cli_rs

## Description
This project is setup as a straightforward Rust CLI app for handling basic task management through CRUD operations.  It will be built with a focus on being modular and scalable, setting it up as a solid boilerplate for more complex scenarios. As part of its development, we will employ a repository pattern to abstract data access. This approach will allow for seamless switching between different data sources, such as local file access or API interactions. This will allow the use of file-based storage for offline/testing/prototyping and allowing for other use cases e.g. cloud, RESTful API integration, microservices, and other distributed use cases. 


## Technology
This project is built using the following technologies:
- **Rust**: A fast and memory-efficient language, ideal for building reliable and efficient software.
- **Clap**: A powerful library for creating command-line interfaces in Rust.
- **Serde**: A framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures efficiently and generically.

## Features
- **Create**: Add new tasks with descriptions.
- **Read**: List all existing tasks.
